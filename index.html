      <p style="font-family:ui-rounded; font-size:30px">There are 2 things I love to do. Code and play video games. I really like making Wii U and 3DS homebrew with LÖVE potion which is a 2D lua framwork for 3DS, Wii U, and switch based off of LÖVE2D. Currently, my favorite video games are Hollow Knight and Hollow Knight: Silksong. I also enjoy playing the Sonic The Hedgehog series and Roblox (specifically Forsaken and Outcome Memories).</p>
